NOTES FROM DAWSON:
    Features to add/stuff to fix if time permits:
        -add a confirm email feature
        -add forgot password feature
        -add features to change password, name, email, and maybe username on the my profile page.
        -sort search results alphabetically
        -make the error page adapt to any error code
        -add see password feature
        -make everything mobile friendly
        -add search by description
        -add a next/previous page to the bottom of the search results as well
        -add an enlarge button rather than automatically enlarging images on search page
        -there might be a better/more secure way to get user information to the user page by using login authentication response
        -limit the number of login/registration attempts
        -Add a save button in the search page, rather than having to add by ID.
    Bugs you need to fix and things to smooth out:
        -when searching something specific, all pages should have 10 search results except maybe the last one
        -reorganize images and have consistent names
        -common name should be checked by default in search
        -it seems like you could inject a true value for the recaptcha
        -meet the creators looks weird on mobile
        -clean out unneeded console logs and comments
        -there's something wrong with PUT requests
        -encrypt the recaptcha key on github so it isn't scraped
        -the team member descriptions need a tad more padding
