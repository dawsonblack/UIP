NOTES FROM DAWSON:
    Features to add/stuff to fix if time permits:
            -add a confirm email feature
            -add forgot password feature
            -sort search results alphabetically
            -make the error page adapt to any error code
            -it's trivially easy to break through the registration page
            -add little red asterisks next to required fields in register form
            -you shouldn't be able to go to the login page unless you're not logged in
    Things you need to add:
        -make everything mobile friendly
        -add search by description
        -add a next/previous page to the bottom of the search results as well
        -add an enlarge button rather than automatically enlarging images on search page
        -finish the user page
    Bugs you need to fix and things to smooth out:
        -REMEMBER TO DISABLE BUTTON BEFORE DEMO
        -when searching something specific, all pages should have 10 search results except maybe the last one
        -reorganize images and have consistent names
        -common name should be checked by default in search
        -get recaptcha to check properly in the backend
