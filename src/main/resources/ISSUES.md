NOTES FROM DAWSON:
-make background one image that moves rather than multiple instances on the screen
-some of the images stretch and look weird in search results
-boolean values are not displayed in stats
-search by booleans is being weird also
-consider adding a search by anything option
-add a README.md
-search function runs through all results no matter what, even if the user left the search bar blank
